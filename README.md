# Animated SVG

SVGs are powerful vector-based graphics that can scale without losing quality. When paired with CSS or JavaScript, they can be animated to create dynamic and interactive visual elements for websites or applications.


## Features

- **Responsive and Scalable:** SVGs maintain their quality at any screen size or resolution.
- **Customizable:** Modify colors, shapes, and animation speeds.
-  **Lightweight:** Smaller file sizes compared to traditional images.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works on all modern browsers.
- **Interaction Support:** Can be controlled and triggered with JavaScript events.
